# Agents Introduuction - Crew AI
Agentic AI and agents are gaining new popularity and stand poised to user in a new world of helpful AI. This repo is a companion repo to the [article](https://medium.com/@markmikeobrien/the-rise-of-ai-agents-anatomy-types-and-practical-applications-d9a9e5f2e23b) released on Medium which covers this top as an introduction

## A New Paradigm
In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, AI agents are emerging as the next big paradigm shift. These autonomous entities are designed to interact not only with humans but also with each other, opening up exciting possibilities for problem-solving and automation.

AI agents represent a significant leap forward, enabling more adaptive and collaborative approaches to complex tasks. Unlike traditional software, AI agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can "think" through problems with unprecedented flexibility.

The core components of an AI agent include:
* Memory for learning from past experiences
* Reasoning capabilities powered by LLMs
* Tool use for augmenting abilities
* Coordination for working with other agents

AI agents come in various types, from simple reflex agents to sophisticated utility-based agents, each representing increasing levels of decision-making complexity.

## Getting Started
Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` & `SERPER_API_KEY` with your own keys before running

Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install all requirements 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run app.py file
